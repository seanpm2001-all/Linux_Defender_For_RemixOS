// Project language file 2
// For: Linux Defender for RemixOS
// About
// I chose SCSS as the second project language file for this project (Linux Defender for RemixOS) as SCSS is being used as a backup stylesheet language for this project, as I can't use QML for this project, and a backup stylesheet is needed for when Java/Assembly/C needs support to do something. I wanted to use SCSS over CSS for software diversity reasons. */
/* Now to make this a multi-purpose file, I will add styling for a basic SCSS template */
